# employee-database
This is the master branch, where all the final working code is added.

In this project, there are 3 files, HTML, CSS and JS file. These files are supposed to be downloaded. The HTML file is to be opened in the browser. This project is about an employee database where all the details about the employees that are added are stored in localStorage for future reference. LocalStorage retains thhe data even after closing the tab, unlike Session Storage which stores the data only for that session(until the tab or browser is closed). Hence by making use of localStorage, we can preserve the details even after closing the browser, so that the next time you open this page, the previously stored details automatically get displayed on the screen.
